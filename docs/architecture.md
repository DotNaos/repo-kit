# Architecture

`project-toolkit` v1 starts as a TypeScript CLI with one agent backend and filesystem-based skill discovery, with room to expand into broader project operations.

## Source Layout

- `src/cli/`
  - command parsing
  - terminal output
- `src/core/`
  - shared types
  - skill discovery and loading
  - minimal repository context collection
  - authentication checks
  - repository-local config loading
  - project scaffold initialization
  - session JSONL logging
  - dev command wrapper for local workflows
- `src/adapters/codex-sdk/`
  - the only agent backend in v1
  - maps `plan` and `run` into Codex SDK thread execution
- `skills/`
  - bundled skills and supporting assets
- `docs/`
  - usage and publishing notes

## Execution Flow

1. The CLI resolves the packaged `skills/` directory.
2. `skills list` inspects each first-level skill directory and reports whether it is runnable.
3. `project init` scaffolds `.project-toolkit/config.yaml` and `.project-toolkit/base.code-workspace` as the stable in-repo foundation for later worktree and workspace commands.
4. `plan` and `run` load a single skill, collect minimal context from the current working directory, and require a Git repository.
5. `plan`, `run`, and `dev` load `.project-toolkit/config.yaml` when present.
6. `plan` and `run` create a per-session JSONL log file before invoking the adapter.
7. The Codex adapter starts a thread with the current repository as the working directory and the selected skill directory exposed via `additionalDirectories`.
8. `plan` uses read-only sandboxing and a structured JSON plan schema.
9. `run` uses workspace-write sandboxing and returns the agent response plus basic execution summaries.
10. `dev` wraps either an explicit subprocess or a configured shell command, tees terminal output, and appends structured output events to the same JSONL session log.

## Skill Compatibility

The loader prefers normalized skills:

- `skill.yaml`
- `prompt.md`
- optional `assets/`, `templates/`, `scripts/`

To avoid rewriting the current catalog, v1 also accepts:

- `SKILL.md`
- a single markdown file fallback for older prompt-only entries

Directories without a prompt definition are intentionally left invalid instead of guessing at runnable behavior from raw assets.

## Logging and config MVP

- Configuration is optional and repository-local at `.project-toolkit/config.yaml`.
- `project init` writes both the config scaffold and `.project-toolkit/base.code-workspace` so future generated workspaces can replace only the active `folders` section while keeping a stable base file in the repo.
- Session logs are JSONL files written to `logs/project-toolkit/` by default, or to `logs.dir` when configured.
- Each session log entry includes a timestamp, random session id, cwd, git root, event source, event type, severity, and optional command or skill metadata.
- The CLI keeps human-readable terminal output separate from structured logs so local workflows stay friendly while automation stays inspectable.
